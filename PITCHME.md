## What is Prometheus?

+++

Prometheus is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit base on purely numeric time series.

### Why Prometheus?

+++

#### Scalability

> To put some numbers behind this: a single big Prometheus server can easily store millions of time series, with a record of 800,000 incoming samples per second (as measured with real production metrics data at SoundCloud). Given a 10-seconds scrape interval and 700 time series per host, this allows you to monitor over 10,000 machines from a single Prometheus server.

## Concepts

+++

### Timeseries

#### Stream of samples of the same metric and the same set of labels

#### Sample
- a float64 value
- a millisecond-precision timestamp

#### Events vs. state
Prometheus collects the state and not single events (like the count of http requests and not the single requests).

+++

### Scraping

Pulling metrics via HTTP (aka scraping)

#### Why Pull?
- Simple client implementation
- No client configuration
- No performance overhead on the client as they only update counters
- Easy debugging on the client (with your browser)
- Immediately notice when a target is down

---

## Metric Types
- Counter
- Gauge
- Histogram
- Summary

+++

### Counter

##### a single numerical value that only ever goes up
##### Counter resets are handled by the server

+++

### Gauge

##### a single numerical value that can arbitrarily go up and down.

+++

### Histogram

##### samples observations (usually things like request durations or response sizes) and counts them in configurable buckets

+++

### Summary

##### summaries calculate streaming Ï†-quantiles on the client side
